# Help Docs
Help Docs helps you in creating a help section in the WordPress admin.

Help Docs does this by creating a custom post type that is only visible on the backend. You then create content just like any WordPress post or page, publish it, and you're done. 

You can create as many pages as you want, assign parents, and it'll all be displayed on the main Help Docs page.

Currently Help Docs uses the classic editor as Gutenberg is not available for private custom post types yet.

At this time, the plugin doesn't auto update so check back periodically for updates
